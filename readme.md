# My Personal Website

I am creating this as an alternative to my personal website at https://mushfiqmahmud.com

Currently I am making use of the following technologies:
* scss for styling
* webpack for typescript bundling
* nodejs for package management

I am going to try to develop this using simple technologies and without using a framework like React, Angular or Vue.
